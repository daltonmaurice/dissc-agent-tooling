# Multi-step approach to Context Engineering

0.  **Tasks**
    * Operating on a task basis. Store all intermediate context in markdown files in `tasks/<task-id>/` folders.
    * Use semantic task id slugs

1.  **Research**
    * Find existing patterns in this codebase
    * Search internet if relevant
    * Start by asking follow up questions to set the direction of research
    * Report findings in `research.md` file

2.  **Planning**
    * Read the `research.md` in tasks for `<task-id>`.
    * Based on the research come up with a plan for implementing the user request. We should reuse existing patterns, components and code where possible.
    * If needed, ask clarifying questions to user to understand the scope of the task
    * Write the comprehensive plan to `plan.md`. The plan should include all context required for an engineer to implement the feature.

3.  **Implementation**
    a.  Read `plan.md` and create a todo-list with all items, then execute on the plan.
    b.  Go for as long as possible. If ambiguous, leave all questions to the end and group them.
    c. Reuse code where possible
    d. all test should be in the `tasks/<task-id>/test` folder ```
